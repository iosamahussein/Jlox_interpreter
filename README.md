#  Just for study purpose  

### In thes repo, we will biuld a jlox interpreter by using the book Crafting Interpreters by Bob Nystrom.

### The interpreter will be written in Java, and will be able to run the Lox language.

### The Lox language is a simple, dynamically typed language that is similar to JavaScript.

### The interpreter will be able to run Lox programs, and will also be able to run a REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) that will allow the user to type in Lox code and see the results of the code immediately.

### The interpreter will also be able to run Lox code from files.

### The code will be commented as we go along, so that it is easy to follow along with the book.
